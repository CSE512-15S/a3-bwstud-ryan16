### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

We were unable to achieve many of the desired effects, only settling on a focus late in the aassignment period. 


## Development Process

The work was divided between myself and Ryan according to our abilities. We both participated in research, exploring a variety of NASA, ESA and other data sets. After selecting a direction, I explored interaction and layout through sketches, while Ryan began developing a D3 prototype. I attempted to help program the visualization, but the majority of the credit belongs to Ryan.

We spent somewhere between 25-30 hours each working on this assignment, spanning research, ideation, sketching, in-person meetings and remote work. What took the most time would probably depend on who you asked. My attempts to code portions of the visualization were the most painstaking, but I spent more hours researching and exploring different designs. Ryan did a great deal of research and spent much of his time coding.
